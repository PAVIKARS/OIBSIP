3. It will be necessary to include a display screen that shows the user's input and provides the results.

4. The CSS grid system is used to align buttons on the calculator.

5. Additional tools required to construct a fully functional calculator encompass event listeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and more.

6. I also implemented a dark/light mode feature, enhancing the website's aesthetics.



# Task- 2/Tribute Page
1. With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, we can easily create a page for someone you admire.
